        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am Gautham Siva, I'm 23 years old. I like movies, art, video games and sports. I 
            believe that learning Web Development is an exciting new oppurtunity for me. I enjoy the way that writing
            and ideating works, the process is quite challenging but also satisfying.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope to use the skills I learn in this diploma to work in the Media industry. It's my dream to direct a film
            & I see this as a step on the way to that. Even if it seems unrelated. So far I'm enjoying HTML and I am excited to
            learn more.
        </p>
